This project is a Cat Classification application developed in Python. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify images as containing a cat or not. The project includes functionalities for image preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
# Cat Classification Project

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based application that classifies images as containing a cat or not. It uses Python for the core functionality and relies on popular libraries for image processing and machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for developing the project.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and performance metrics.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.

## Functions and Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Functions to resize, normalize, and augment images before feeding them into the model.
- **Model Training**: Script to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of labeled images.
- **Prediction**: Function to predict whether an image contains a cat based on the trained model.
- **Evaluation**: Script to evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Plots to visualize the model's accuracy, loss over epochs, and confusion matrix.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
