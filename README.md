# cat-detector
This project is a Cat Classification application developed in Python. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify images as containing a cat or not. The project includes functionalities for image preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
# Image Classification with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a logistic regression model for image classification. It involves training the model on a dataset of images, tuning hyperparameters, and testing the model on new images. The primary goal is to classify images into different categories based on their features.

## Project Structure

- **logistic_regression.py:** Contains the implementation of the logistic regression model, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation functions.
- **model.py:** Includes functions for building, training, and predicting with the logistic regression model.
- **utils.py:** Provides utility functions for data preprocessing and evaluation.
- **images/:** Directory containing sample images for testing.
- **data/:** Directory for storing and managing dataset files.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
- **README.md:** This file.
